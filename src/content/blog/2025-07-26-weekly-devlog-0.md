This week I finished the rework of the combat/action system, allowing for more interesting spells and combat abilities.

In total, I created 4 new spells to test the capabilities of the system, which might or might not exist in the game in the future:
<ul>
    <li><b>Firebolt</b>: Fires a fiery arrow at a single target, dealing damage and setting them on fire</li>
    <li><b>Fireball</b>: Fires an explosive fire ball, that deals fire damage to all creatures in an area</li>
    <li><b>Rock Pillar</b>: Spawns an indestructible rock pillar, allowing you to block enemies</li>
    <li><b>Teleport</b>: Teleports you away, for getting out of sticky situations.</li>
</ul>

I also included a cooldown on some abilities as a new way of balancing the abilities.
