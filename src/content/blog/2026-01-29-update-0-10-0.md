Hey everyone!

The Open Alpha 0.10.0 is now available for [download on Itch.io](https://jouwee.itch.io/tales-of-kathay)!

In this update we focus on adding a new full-fledged tribal species to the game, the **Grokker**! We also add lootable containers, traps, and AI improvements.

# Grokkra

The grokkra are small humanoid creatures, hostile towards humans, but not very technologically advanced. They live in small tribes, and rely on makeshift weapons, slings, and crude traps.

However, they have a skill that no human can replicate, they can create "Grokker Amber": A dried and polished resin that they make from their bodies. It's better not to think much about it, but it has some unique properties when imbued into weapons!

Grokkra will often attack human settlements, and you can likely find village leaders with open contracts for the grokker leader!

To support the grokkra, they have access to a new weapon: the sling. It is not very powerful, but allows you to attack from a distance - useful good in group tactics. They also have access to two new traps, hidden dangers that can take anyone sneaking around the camp by surprise!

# AI Changes

The AI has undergone some changes to make the combat vs the semi-intelligent grokkra more interesting. Aggroed NPCs will now get the attention of nearby NPCs, that will investigate what's going on. Children and other weak NPCs will also now prefer fleeing over fighting the player.

# New lootable containers

Barrels are now lootable, opening a small screen that allows you to pickup what you want. You can't place items into the container yet, though. Barrels will have loot in Grokker camps at the moment.

# New Intuition attribute & Perception stat

To support the new trap mechanics, a new *Intuition* attribute has been created, and the "Perception bonus" that is derived from it. The perception bonus will allow you to spot traps more easily.
