Hey everyone!

Version 0.5.0 is now available for download as an alpha version!

In this update, the focus was on creating a new enemy and dungeon, and evolve the systems in the game to allow for more interesting and dynamic fights.

# New dungeon

In this updating we're adding a new enemy, the Giant Spider, along with a new special dungeon and quest.

The Giant Spider is a mid to end-game enemy, with 150 health points, a poisonous bite that will slowly drain your health, and the ability to restrain the player's movement with its web.

They live deep in the caves of the world, and their nests are filled with webs that can hold you back. But fret not, you can use your attacks or fire to destroy the webs and pass without an issue. Just be sure you don't have to do that while fleeing the nest!

# Fire

I've also added a simple fire simulation - a suitable way of dealing with spiders! Fire is inflicted by the fire spells (Firebolt and Fireball) on flammable objects, and spread to nearby flammable objects. This will happen after everyone took their turns, in a new "Environmental" turn.
