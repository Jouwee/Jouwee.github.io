Hey everyone!

The Open Alpha 0.9.0 is now available for [download on Itch.io](https://jouwee.itch.io/tales-of-kathay)!

In this update we expand the crafting system, adding blacksmithing and tailoring, as well as specific skills for different crafting types. There are several new materials with unique properties, new armor pieces, and multiple new crafting recipes.

# Obtaining materials

The largest change in gameplay from this update is working and progressing throught different materials. You can now collect hides, bones, purchase linens and metal ingots, all with different properties and bonuses. Mix and match all of these materials into the equipment you craft, inching closer to thew perfect build.

**Hides and bones** can be aquired by butchering the corpse of different animals that you'll encounter through your playthrough. Bones can be used in certain weapons as handles, hilts or pommels. The hides are the primary material for most leather armor. **Ingots** can be purchased from blacksmiths, and are the primary material for weapons and metal armor; **Wool and linens** can be purchased from the new Tailor craftsman, and are used for clothing and cosmetic items. And **logs** can be harvested from trees, as long as you have an axe.

# Expanded Crafting

The crafting system has been expanded to support these new materials. Most equipment in the game are now craftable, and the recipes are unlocked as you progress through the respective skill: Blacksmithing, Tailoring and Survival. Your level will also affect the quality of the produced item.

The item tooltip has also got a lot of love, showing pretty much all underlying information, such as bonuses, damage, value, quality, materials used, etc.

# Tailor

You can now find tailors in towns and villages. They sell all sorts of clothing items, leather armor and cloth rolls for your own crafting. They might also request animal hides from time to time!
