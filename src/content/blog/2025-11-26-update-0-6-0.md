Hey everyone!

The Open Alpha 0.6.0 is now available for [download on Itch.io](https://jouwee.itch.io/tales-of-kathay)!

In this update, the focus was reworking quests for a system that is more interesting and hopefully will remain indefintely in the game.

# New quests and quests system.

The main update in this version is the quest rework.

Now, quests are created through the history simulation, based on events that happened and NPC needs and wants. To support these new quests, a new concept of "encounters" was also added. They are basically small structures that show the event in a concrete form in the world. For instance, if a caravan was attacked by a pack of coyotes, you might find their corpse, a broken cart, and some other details that tells this story. In total, 5 quests/encounters were added.

There's also the new notice board, an object that will always spawn in front of the townhall of villages, and will contain all available quests from that village.

You can still talk to people to get quests from them, and the chat screen got a new look!
