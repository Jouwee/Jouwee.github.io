## Important update about the Open Alpha

I'll be ending the Open Alpha for Tales of Kathay shortly, transitioning to a Closed Alpha exclusive for [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/Jouwee) supporters.

You'll still be able to play a demo version of the game for free on Itch, with limited options for world size and playthrough duration.

The game will still be updated regularly, but the access will be restricted to Patreon supporters of any paid tier.

To continue playing the updated versions of Tales of Kathay, consider becoming a member on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/Jouwee). **I still have a few updates planned for the Open Alpha, so you can wait a bit before becoming a member.**

If you have donated through Itch, I'll figure out a way for you to still have access to the updated Alpha versions.

Hey everyone!

The Open Alpha 0.12.0 is now available for [download on Itch.io](https://jouwee.itch.io/tales-of-kathay)!

In this update I'm adding a new system to the game, called Traits. All characters spawn with randomized traits that gives them bonuses or penalties, making each character more unique. In total, 12 traits were added.

I've also polished the player experience around the actual game, like creating a new Crate World screen, character selection and death screen.

Finally, there's now an in-game contextual hint system to help new players better grasp the concepts of the game.

# Traits

Every character in the world will now have randomized traits, that modify their attributes, stats, and how likely they are to perform certain actions. 

In total, there are 12 traits added, with 6 of them being positive, and 6 being negative. From some simple attribute changing traits, such as the Strong trait, that gives you to +2 Strength, to the Slow Learner trait, that reduces XP gain by 20%.

# New World, Character Selection and Death screens

I've added new screens for creating worlds, character selection, and after your character has died. These new screens not only are there to give clarity and context to what the game is doing, but also gives the player new options on how to play the game.

The "New World" screen allows you to select the world size and history length, as well as the world's seed, if you want to replay a particularly interesting world.

The "Character Selection" screen gives you a roster of characters from the world to choose from, instead of the game randomly assigning one to you. You can carefully select the best character for you, viewing their traits, attributes and starting skills. Or you can select someone with a particulary interesting backstory, based on their life's events.

Finally, I have revamped the Death screen to be more impactfull, and recount the Tale of the played character.

# Contextual Hints

There's now a few hints that might pop up during play, with the intent to help new players get a grasp of the game mechanics. These hints also replace the content of the Help Screen, and will only show once per playthrough.
