Hello everyone!

I have deeply underestimated the time it would take to create the new abilities I had planned, so this week the work continues on the skill and leveling system.

Sadly this means the 0.3 release won't come out this week, but I'm 90% of the way there.

So far I have implemented 7 of the 10 new abilities I want to have for version 0.3, and have mostly finished all of the other features I had planned.

Since this is a shorter devlog, I'll leave you with a short clip of a boss fight using some of the new abilities!

This is it for this week, and don't forget to [wishlist Tales of Kathay on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3939340/Tales_of_Kathay/)!
