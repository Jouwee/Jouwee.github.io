Hey everyone!

The Open Alpha 0.7.0 is now available for [download on Itch.io](https://jouwee.itch.io/tales-of-kathay)!

In this update, the focus was the creation of a basic crafting system and improving the controls and balance of the game.

# New crafting system

I have added a new simple crafting system. Currently, there are three recipes, but the basis is present to expand and add more.

Two of those crafting recipes require a **workstation**, a tile in the world that works as said workstation, like a Cauldron for potion brewing or a campfire for cooking.
