<p>This project is now called <strong>Tales of Kathay</strong>.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I released the last version. This is partly because I took a couple of weeks off, but also because I remade a lot of art, UI and rendering.</p>

<p>My goal with this version was to make it look more like a game, even if still unpolished. Because of that, there's not many new features, but a lot of updating.</p>

<ul>
    <li>[new] The game is now called <strong>Tales of Kathay</strong></li>
    <li>[new] Artifacts are now more common and have names</li>
    <li>[new] When someone kills someone with an artifact, they can now take the artifact</li>
    <li>[new] Added music and sound effects</li>
    <li>[new] Remade pretty much all sprites</li>
    <li>[new] Remade the map generation and map navigation scenes</li>
    <li>[new] There's now an actual UI</li>
    <li>[new] Added simple animations and damage indicators</li>
    <li>[bug] World generation wasn't deterministic</li>
</ul>
