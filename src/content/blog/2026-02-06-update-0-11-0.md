Hey everyone!

The Open Alpha 0.11.0 is now available for [download on Itch.io](https://jouwee.itch.io/tales-of-kathay)!

In this update I've reworked the biomes of the game, making them more distinct, and adding a third biome: The Taiga.

# New biomes

Previously, the biomes only had a tiny impact on the game, changing the sprite in the map screen, and choosing what creatures to spawn. 

Now, they're truly different from one another. Each biome can generate different trees, plants and animals, with different densities. The 3 current biomes are:

**Temperate Prairie**

Previously called grasslands, this biome is rich in healing herbs and coyotes, but you won't find many trees around. Grokker really like to live here.

**Temperate Deciduous Forest**

Previously called forest, this biome is composed of dense oak and birch woodlands populated by wolves and bears.

**Taiga**

The new biome, a cold forest composed mostly of pines. Grokker avoid the colder regions, leaving it for the wildlife and the terrifying Varningr.

# Challenge Rating

Quest difficulty has been reworked to revolve around a concept or Challenge Rating, or CR. The CR is a score computed for every quest, and also for the player, and it's an estimate of how hard a fight will be. A high CR creature has a higher chance of winning against a low CR creature. The quest difficulty is based on the difference between your own CR and the quests CR.
