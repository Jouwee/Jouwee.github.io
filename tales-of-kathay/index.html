        <h1>Tales of Kathay</h1>

        <p>Tales of Kathay is a fantasy turn-based RPG. Your goal is to uncover the ancient secrets of a completely procedural world.</p>

        <p>Current stage: <b>Proof of Concept</b>. I'm working on this game as a hobby project since november of 2024, and it's very much incomplete.</p>

        <p><b>How do I play?</b>. I don't consider the game to be at a playable state at the moment. In the following months, I hope to release a demo-scoped playable version for free.</p>

            <h4>Weekly devlog #0</h4>
            <small>by Jouwee, 2025-08-02</small>
            This week I finished the rework of the combat/action system, allowing for more interesting spells and combat abilities.

            In total, I created 4 new spells to test the capabilities of the system, which might or might not exist in the game in the future:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Firebolt</b>: Fires a fiery arrow at a single target, dealing damage and setting them on fire</li>
                <li><b>Fireball</b>: Fires an explosive fire ball, that deals fire damage to all creatures in an area</li>
                <li><b>Rock Pillar</b>: Spawns an indestructible rock pillar, allowing you to block enemies</li>
                <li><b>Teleport</b>: Teleports you away, for getting out of sticky situations.</li>
            </ul>

            <video src="media/0_0_15.mp4" controls="true"></video>

            I also included a cooldown on some abilities as a new way of balancing the abilities.
