        <h1>Tales of Kathay</h1>

        <p>Tales of Kathay is a fantasy turn-based RPG. Your goal is to uncover the ancient secrets of a completely procedural world.</p>

        <p>Current stage: <b>Proof of Concept</b>. I'm working on this game as a hobby project since november of 2024, and it's very much incomplete.</p>

        <p><b>How do I play?</b>. I don't consider the game to be at a playable state at the moment. In the following months, I hope to release a demo-scoped playable version for free.</p>

        <p>Contact me via Github on <a href="https://github.com/Jouwee/history-generator-rpg">https://github.com/Jouwee/history-generator-rpg</a></p>

            <p>It's been a while since I released the last version. This is partly because I took a couple of weeks off, but also because I remade a lot of art, UI and rendering.</p>

            <p>My goal with this version was to make it look more like a game, even if still unpolished. Because of that, there's not many new features, but a lot of updating.</p>
