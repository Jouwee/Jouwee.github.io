        <p>It's been a while.</p>

        <p>After the last version, back in february, it became clear to me that some big changes were needed in the backend of the project.</p>

        <p>I spent a few weeks just doing some background processing, and came to the conclusion that the whole history simulation should be reworked.</p>

        History simulation rework:
        <ul>
            <li>Now every single person is simulated;</li>
            <li>Simulation is significantly faster;</li>
            <li>Removed wars and great beasts - to return in a future update;</li>
        </ul>

        Town generation rework:
        <ul>
            <li>New algorithm for building generation;</li>
            <li>Old or abandoned towns generate ruins;</li>
        </ul>
